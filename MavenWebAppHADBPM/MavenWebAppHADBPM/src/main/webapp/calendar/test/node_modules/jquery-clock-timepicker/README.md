==================================

<img src="http://plugins.slyweb.ch/jquery-clock-timepicker/screenshot.png" alt="jquery-clock-timepicker screenshot" />

[See a demo here](http://plugins.slyweb.ch/jquery-clock-timepicker)

A free jQuery Plug-in to select the time with a clock inspired by the Android time picker. This plugin works on Desktop and Mobile phones.


Requirements
------------
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)


Installation
------------

Install from [NPM](http://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery-clock-timepicker) as ```jquery-clock-timepicker```.

```npm install jquery-clock-timepicker```


Usage
-----

```javascript
$('.your-time-field').clockTimePicker(options);
```

Include the file `jquery-clock-timepicker.min.js` in your page. There is no need of a CSS file.

The Plug-in is customizable through the optional ```options``` object passed to the jQuery method, i.e.

```javascript
$('.your-time-field').clockTimePicker({
	duration: true,
	durationNegative: true,
	precision: 5,
	i18n: {
		cancelButton: 'Abbrechen'
	},
	onAdjust: function(newVal, oldVal) {
		//...
	}
});
```

If you want to set new options at runtime (after an input element already has been intialized), just call the function again with all desired options.

If you want to dispose/destroy an initialized clock time picker element, please use the following code:

```javascript
$('.your-time-field').clockTimePicker('dispose');
```

If you want to change the value programmatically at runtime on an already initialized clock time picker element, use the following code:

```javascript
$('.your-time-field').clockTimePicker('value', '08:00');
```
